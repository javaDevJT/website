# Hello  


Welcome to my website. I hope that you find some of the content intriguing. To start off, I will introduce myself.
<br>
<br>
My name is Joshua Terk.<br>

### Professional
I am a software engineer at General Motors, and lead an SRE team responsible for In-Vehicle Product Cybersecurity applications. These applications consist of a suite of primarily Spring Boot applications running in a mix of containerized and VM environments. Throughput is in the millions of requests per day, and certain aspects of the suite are in the critical path for releasing software, unlocking ECUs (such as at dealerships), and manufacturing vehicles in real-time. Therefore, it goes without saying that these are vital to my company, and I am proud to lead such an important team.
### Personal
I am married to my beautiful wife, Michela, and we live together in the Detroit metro. I grew up in Texas, before graduating from Auburn University with a Bachelor's in Computer Science in 2021. Immediately following graduation, I escaped the heat of the south for Michigan. My interests align with my career path; For my entire life, I have had a significant interest in the automotive industry, as well as technology, making it extremely appropriate for my career path to lead me to intersection of the Automotive-Technology Venn-Diagram. I am careful to note that I consider myself an automotive industry enthusiast first, and 'car' enthusiast second, due to the fact that many car enthusiasts would consider is sacrilege that my preferred method of transport is electric cars. I do still have a special place in my heart for ICE vehicles, though!
